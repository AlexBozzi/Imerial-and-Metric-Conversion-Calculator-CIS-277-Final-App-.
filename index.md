## Welcome to my Imperial/Metric Conversion Repo

This appplication was designed to allow users to convert nearly any unit of measurement between Imperial and Metric. It was specifically designed with user freandliness and reusability in mind. 

### Who benifits from this app?

The nice thing about including so many different units of measurment to convert from is that so many differnt groups of people can find it useful. The main beneficiaries are students, scientists, mathematicians, scientists and people, on vacation. Cooks, athletes, and military personnel among many others could find use out of it as well.
